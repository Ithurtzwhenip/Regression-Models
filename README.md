# Regression Models 

Welcome to the Regression Models repository! This repository contains Python code implementing various regression models using the scikit-learn library. The models included are:

1. **Simple Linear Regression Model**
2. **Multiple Linear Regression Model**
3. **Polynomial Regression Model**
4. **Support Vector Regression Model**
5. **Decision Tree Regression Model**
6. **Random Forest Regression Model**

## Simple Linear Regression Model

This model establishes a linear relationship between a single independent variable and the dependent variable. The provided code uses the scikit-learn library to train a simple linear regression model on a dataset ('Salary_Data.csv') and visualizes both training and test results.

## Multiple Linear Regression Model

Extending simple linear regression, this model incorporates multiple independent variables to predict the dependent variable. The code uses '50_Startups.csv' as a dataset, encodes categorical data, and demonstrates the training and evaluation process.

## Polynomial Regression Model

Polynomial Regression captures non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial features. The code applies polynomial regression on the 'Position_Salaries.csv' dataset, visualizing both linear and polynomial regression results.

## Support Vector Regression Model

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a regression algorithm that uses support vector machines. The provided code uses SVR to predict salaries based on positions from the 'Position_Salaries.csv' dataset and visualizes the results.

## Decision Tree Regression Model

Decision Tree Regression builds a tree-like model to make predictions. The code trains a Decision Tree Regression model on the 'Position_Salaries.csv' dataset and visualizes the results.

## Random Forest Regression Model

Random Forest Regression combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness. The code uses 'Position_Salaries.csv' to train a Random Forest Regression model and visualizes the predictions.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these regression models for your projects. Don't forget to replace the dataset paths in the code with your own dataset paths when using this repository.
